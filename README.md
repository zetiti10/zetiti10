# üëã Hi there! I'm zetiti10!

## üìñ About me

I'm a French student with a deep passion for electronics, 3D printing, video games, and nature!

Although I'm not a professional programmer, I have learned some specific skills for different purposes. I have utilized Java for a Minecraft plugin and C++ for Arduino. I also share some of my projects on GitHub, so feel free to check them out!

Here are some tools I frequently use:

My ultimate goal is to become an engineer, so I dedicate myself to working hard and striving to achieve my ambitions.

In the past, I created and administrated a Minecraft server until 2023. However, currently, I am focusing on other personal projects.
